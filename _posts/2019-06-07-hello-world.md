Welcome to my blog!

After blogging for a while on [https://blog.netinfluence.ch](https://blog.netinfluence.ch),
in French, I wanted to start writing in English too. Hence this blog!
I will continue publishing articles on both, though. They will have different topics and approaches.
Here, I will try to dig into more advanced Symfony topics.

<!-- more-->

Being a personal blog, you may also find opinion posts about
web development or software engineering, in general.  
On "Talks" page, I will post all my slides from past conferences, and upcoming events I will speak to.

I wanted a minimalistic but not austere design.
I don't quite like meaningless stock photos, so being a hiking addict,
I will use some personal photos to illustrate here and here. So you can enjoy the view too :)

Later on, I may add Disqus comments.  
Meanwhile, the discussion continues on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/romaricdrigon)
or you can drop me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>

I hope you will enjoy reading it as much as I do writing it,  
Romaric
